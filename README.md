# genesis-controller-test

Very basic demonstration of interfacing a Sega Genesis game controller with an Arduino.

Pushing various buttons on the controller turns various outputs on or off. For the demo, I wired the outputs to LEDs.

For more details, see the [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDlX7lPET8).
